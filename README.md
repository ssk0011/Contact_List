# Contact_List
A database terminal program with features for adding, deleting, editing, and searching for contacts based on a csv file.

The current setup calls for the csv file to be called "contact_list.csv," with the location to be based in user.home. This can be changed within the code. A sample copy of contact_list.csv has been included as well.

The contact_list.csv's records are all fake, and were generated by: http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/order.php

The code was originally based on: http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/writeread-csv-files-in-java-example/

It was modified to include multiple features to mimick a database-esque program.
