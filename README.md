# Contact_List
A database terminal program with features for adding, deleting, editing, and searching for contacts based on a csv file.

The current setup calls for the csv file to be called "contact_list.csv," with the location to be based in user.home. This can be changed within the code. A sample copy of contact_list.csv has been included as well.
